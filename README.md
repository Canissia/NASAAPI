# NASAAPI
Uses NASA api to display photo

This project uses NASA APOD API. I wanted to create a page that uses the Api to display an image, title, and its explanation.

There are two buttons, one that loads image and information and another that returns to the homepage.

My challenges were using the asynchronous function to wait for fetch request to return data.
Trouble shooting how to link a button to a webpage using JS in HTML.
